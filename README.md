- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

two conclusions are that more than 50% of theater was sucussful and less than 3 % were cancelled

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

75% of sucessful plays were less than $1000

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Limitations of the dataset is the lack of organization  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
some graphs tha could have been created is outcomes based off of country, sucession of which country made the most , and what years was the highest for donation
