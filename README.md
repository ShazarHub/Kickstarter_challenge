## Overview of Project

### Purpose of this project was to analyze and orgaize data for the fundraising goal

## Some of the challenges i came across was trying to get my code correct for construsting the "Goal" data. 
The analysis was performed using filters and pivot tables to narrow down the data you need for specfic goal data

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

two conclusions are that more than 50% of theater was sucussful and less than 3 % were cancelled

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

75% of sucessful plays were less than $1000

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Limitations of the dataset is the lack of organization  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
some graphs tha could have been created is outcomes based off of country, sucession of which country made the most , and what years was the highest for donation
